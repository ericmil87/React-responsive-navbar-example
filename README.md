# Responsive Navigation Menu in React JS

React Responsive Nav Menu example.

# To add to your project

Make a Copy /components/NavBar.js and /components/NavBar.css

## /components/NavBar.js

Edit /components/NavBar.js, then set title and href for each link you want. You can create as many as you want just make sure to keep an valid array of objects on NavBarLinks.

```
const NavBarLinks = [
{
title: "Home",
href: "/",
},
{
title: "About",
href: "/about",
},
{
title: "Blog",
href: "/blog",
},
{
title: "Contact Us",
href: "/contact",
},
];
```

## ./App.js

```
// Be sure to import NavBar component, React Router and your pages components.

// import "./App.css"; // This is the file for Pages Styles (I guess this will not be needed for your project)
import NavBar from "./components/NavBar"; // This is the NavBar component itself.
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom"; // This is the React Router component needed to use react links

// Importing pages components
import { Home } from "./components/Pages/Home";
import { About } from "./components/Pages/About";
import { Blog } from "./components/Pages/Blog";
import { Contact } from "./components/Pages/Contact";

// then on
function App() {
    return (
        <>
        <Router>
        {/* Render NavBar component */}
        <NavBar />

                <div className="pages">
                <Switch>
                    {/* edit here your Routes and set their path(url) and component */}
                    <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
                    <Route path="/about" component={About} />
                    <Route path="/blog" component={Blog} />
                    <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
                </Switch>
                </div>
            </Router>
        </>

    );
}

export default App;
```

That's all

## Technology

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can???t go back!**

If you aren???t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you???re on your own.

You don???t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn???t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn???t be useful if you couldn???t customize it when you are ready for it.
